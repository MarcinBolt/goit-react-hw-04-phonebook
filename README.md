deploy GitHub Pages You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects, host a blog, or even share your resume. This will guide you to get started on creating your next website.Github-pages

It will create a website with a domain, username.github.io. Eg. Let's consider your username as peter101 and your repo name as OnTheGo. Then it will make a website with the domain peter101.github.io/OnTheGo/.

Steps for the Deployment The following steps must be followed in serial-wise.

We will create a seperate gh-pages branch that will contain our /dist folder.

Push your code to your repository (using Terminal) cd to your Vite App. Run the following commands in your Terminal $ git init $ git add . $ git commit -m "first-commit" $ git branch -M main $ git remote add origin http://github.com/username/repo-name.git $ git push -u origin main Now, you will able to see your code in your repository.

Deploying (Static) Go to your vite.config.js file. And add your base url to it. Code

To be more precise, your base url will be /repo-name/. In my case, my repo-name is Tech-To. So, my base url will be /Tech-To/.

Run npm run build in your Terminal. By default, the build output will be placed at dist. You may deploy this dist folder to any of your preferred platforms.

Add /dist folder into your repo. By running. $ git add dist -f

-f is required, as your .gitignore will not consider your /dist folder. Hence, it is required for git to consider it as well.

Run $ git commit -m "Adding dist" in your Terminal.

Run $ git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages

Your Deployed website Visit your repository. Go to Settings. Scroll down to Pages. There will be a link to your website. You did it!! GIFcongo
